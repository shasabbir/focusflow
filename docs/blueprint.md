## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 210, 75%, 50% (RGB Hex: #3399FF) to invoke feelings of concentration and clarity. This blue will provide a clean, modern look.
- Background color: HSL 210, 20%, 95% (RGB Hex: #F0F8FF), a very light blue that is easy on the eyes during extended focus sessions.
- Accent color: HSL 180, 60%, 40% (RGB Hex: #33BDBD) to provide clear visual contrast for start/stop buttons and notifications.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, machined look that provides a comfortable reading experience.
- Use simple, geometric icons for the timer controls and settings.
- Subtle, non-distracting animations to indicate timer start/stop and period transitions.
- The focus timer and the controls for it are presented prominently at the top of the display. The color-coded contribution graph appears below. Additional app configuration, if needed, is located in the settings.
